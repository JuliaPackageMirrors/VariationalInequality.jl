JuVI: Julia for Variational Inequalities
----------------------------------------

This package implements solution algorithms for solving finite-dimensional variational inequality (VI) problems of the following form:

To find :math:`y \in X` such that

.. math::
    F(y)^T (x-y) >= 0 \qquad \forall x \in X


where the set :math:`X` is defined by equalities and inequalities.
